# 01_MISSION_BRIEF.md

## 🎯 Project Objective
Transform the `referraltree` PWA into a "2026 Premium" enterprise application. The goal is to move beyond a basic "tracking tool" to a high-end **Sales & Commission Command Center**.
* **Current State:** Functional, utility-focused.
* **Target State:** Tactile, gamified, and highly polished. It should feel like a premium Fintech app (e.g., Stripe, Cash App) for Reps, and a powerful CRM for Admins.

## 👥 The Three Experiences
1.  **Sales Rep (The "Earner"):**
    * *Vibe:* Motivation & Speed.
    * *Key Emotion:* "I am making money."
    * *UX Priority:* One-tap sharing (QR), clear earnings visualization, gamified progress bars.
2.  **Admin (The "Controller"):**
    * *Vibe:* Clarity & Control.
    * *Key Emotion:* "I have the full picture."
    * *UX Priority:* Dense but breathable data tables, drag-and-drop pipeline management, instant search.
3.  **Customer (The "Source"):**
    * *Vibe:* Trust & Simplicity.
    * *Key Emotion:* "This is easy and secure."
    * *UX Priority:* Zero friction. A 3-step wizard to submit a referral.

## 💎 The "2026 App" Aesthetic
* **Visual Language:** "Deep Glass." Dark mode should feel like a cockpit. Light mode should feel like a fresh sheet of paper.
* **Interaction:** Since this is a PWA, we need **Native-Like Physics**.
    * Swipe-to-refresh on dashboards.
    * Bottom sheets (drawers) instead of modals on mobile.
    * Haptic feedback visuals (buttons "press" down).

## 🛠 Tech Stack Directives
* **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router).
* **UI Library:** Introduce `shadcn/ui` for high-quality accessible components (Data Tables, Dialogs, Selects).
* **Charts:** Use `recharts` for earnings graphs.
* **Motion:** `framer-motion` for page transitions (slide-over effect).
